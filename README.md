This is an animated depiction of a planetary system using p5.js
The sun is a 12 sided polygon that pulses with framecount.
Saturn is set to orbit the sun with an off-axis ring of oscillating size.
Earth is depicted as a fastly flashing and rotating hexagon.
Red and green blinking lights flash and relay off each end underneath the author's name.
The cursor has been set to the round waiting symbol to fit with the planetary theme. If placed on another side of the screen, the cursor changes.
If the user clicks the sun a blackhole will form and rapidly expand to fill the screen.
You can only stop the black hole and the universe in its tracks by using keyboard input.
